# Java OOP Studies

This repository contains my studies and practice projects developed while learning **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** in Java.
Each project focuses on a specific concept or exercise and follows the structure of a typical Java/NetBeans project.

## Repository Structure

The repository is organized into individual project folders, each containing source code, configuration, and build files:

```
java-oop-studies/        # Root directory of the repository, containing all Java OOP study projects.
│
├── introduction/         # Theme
│
├── prjExample_1/         # First example project.
│   ├── src/              # Source code of the project.
│   ├── lib/              # External libraries used by the project (JARs, dependencies).
│   ├── nbproject/        # NetBeans IDE configuration files.
│   ├── test/             # Unit or integration tests for the project.
│   ├── build.xml         # Ant build file defining how to compile and package the project.
│   └── manifest.mf       # Java manifest file (contains metadata for JAR packaging).
│
├── prjExample_2/         # Second example project, with the same structure as prjExample_1.
│   ├── src/

│   ├── nbproject/
│   ├── test/

└── README.md             # Repository documentation, with general instructions and information about the projects.

## Learning Objectives

* Practice Java fundamentals and OOP principles.
* Apply concepts such as **classes, objects, attributes, and methods** through exercises.
* Build a foundation for more advanced OOP concepts like inheritance, polymorphism, encapsulation, and abstraction.

# OOP Studies in Java

This repository contains my study materials and practice projects developed during the learning of **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** in Java.
Each project focuses on a specific concept or exercise and follows the typical structure of a Java/NetBeans project.

## Repository Structure

The repository is organized into individual project folders, each containing source code, configuration, and build files:

```
java-oop-studies/        # Root directory of the repository, containing all Java OOP study projects.
│
├── introduction/         # Topic 1
│    ├── prjExample_1/         # First example project.
│    │  ├── src/              # Project source code.
│    │  └── lib/              # External libraries used by the project (JARs, dependencies).
│    │
│    ├── prjExample_2/         # Second example project, with the same structure as prjExample_1.
│    │  ├── src/              
│    │  ├── lib/              
│    │  └── README.md          # Any notes about the exercise
│    │
│    └── prjExercise/          # Exercise project, usually to practice learned concepts.

## Learning Objectives

* Practice Java fundamentals and OOP principles.
* Apply concepts such as **classes, objects, attributes, and methods** through exercises.
* Build a foundation for more advanced OOP concepts such as inheritance, polymorphism, encapsulation, and abstraction.
